# $2^6$ Days of Lua

Did you know that array indexing in Lua starts at 1?

Also, did you know that all the numbers are 64-bit? Hence the name of this repo; well sort-of.

Lua is a smaller language than say JavaScript or Python or Go (100 days repos for those exist), and 64 is >0, <100. It is also a _scripting_ language, hence the ambition of a <100 target.

# Agenda

I shall be following *Programming in Lua* by Roberto lerusalimschy (at least to begin). The code is in the `pil` folder.

# Goal

1. embed /luacode/ in my [math notes](https://github.com/abaj8494/math).
2. understand what is going on in my [neovim configuration](https://github.com/abaj8494/dotfiles)
